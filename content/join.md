Thank you for your interest in our lab!

<!-- **Note to potential applicants:** -->
If you are wondering whether FLAIR is the right place for you, please take a look at our publications on Google Scholar and watch some of our talks on the internet and _only_ email if there are specific follow-up questions. As scientists, we like to hear about any non-obvious insights and interesting follow-up suggestions to previous work!
