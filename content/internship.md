We are looking for two talented students to join us for an internship working in FLAIR for 6 months. Students will get the chance to work on current FLAIR projects at the University of Oxford, gaining practical and theoretical skills in ML with the goal of working towards a top tier conference publication.


**Dates:** 5th January to 4th July 2026 (flexible).

**Applicability:** Current university students (typically Masters or PhD students, but exceptional undergrads will be considered too) who do not require an ATAS security clearance (these students require a 6 month processing lead and should apply for our Summer/Autumn scheme). Note this does not exclude students who require a VISA to work in the UK.


**Interested?** Apply by 18th September 2025 AOE to matthew.fellows@eng.ox.ac.uk using the subject title "[YOUR NAME] FLAIR 2026 Winter/Spring Internship", with the following:

* A CV.
* A short description of the project area youâ€™d like to work on and a list of the appropriate skills you have for the project. Please align with prior and current work from our [research page](/research) and explain if this work will be part of an MSc thesis or similar. Successful applications will focus on high impact, foundational projects.
* Your availability for a short 20 min interview 22nd-25th September between 9am and 6pm UK time.

Funding might be available for project proposals focusing on:

* Human-AI coordination
* RL for optimising mobile phone network protocols
* Computational sciences as LLM Evaluation

**We're excited to hear from you!**
