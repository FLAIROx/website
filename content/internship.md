We are looking for two talented students to join us for an internship working in FLAIR for 6 months. Students will get the chance to work on current FLAIR projects at the University of Oxford, gaining practical and theoretical skills in ML with the goal of working towards a top tier conference publication.

**Dates:** 20th July 2026 to 15th January 2027 (flexible).

**Applicability:** Applicants need to be university students at the start of the placement (20th July) (typically Masters or PhD students, but exceptional undergrads will be considered too). Note this does not exclude students who require a VISA or ATAS clearance to work in the UK. We expect PhD students to have at least one top-tier publication relevant to their subject area (for example NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, RLC, AISTATS, AAAI for ML research).

**Interested?** Apply by 2nd December 2025 AOE using the subject title "[YOUR NAME] FLAIR 2026 Summer/Autumn Internship" to [flairvisitors@eng.ox.ac.uk](mailto:flairvisitors@eng.ox.ac.uk) with the following:
* A CV.
* A short description of the project area you’d like to work on and a list of the appropriate skills you have for the project. Please align with prior and current work from our [research page](/research) and explain if this work will be part of an MSc thesis or similar. Successful applications will focus on high impact, foundational projects.
* Your skills - theoretical and engineering.
* Your availability for a short 20 min interview 8th-12th December between 9am and 6pm UK time.

Funding might be available for project proposals focusing on:
* Human-AI coordination
* RL for optimising mobile phone network protocols
* Computational sciences as LLM Evaluation

**We're excited to hear from you!**
